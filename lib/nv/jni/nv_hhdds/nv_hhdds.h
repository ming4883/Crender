    This function call takes an uncompressed texture in a DDS structure, and

    <ul>
        <li> Pre-compression reduces data footprint over-the-air and on the
            device filesystem
        <li> Image quality of compressed textures is significantly better 
            when generated by offline tools
        <li> Run-time compression increases load time
        <li> Run-time compression consumes additional power
    </ul>

    The currently supported texture formats are:
    <ul>
        <li> GL_RGBA

        <li> GL_LUMINANCE
        <li> GL_ALPHA
