/** @file nv_thread.h
  The NVThread library makes it easy to create native threads that can acess
  JNI objects.  By default, pthreads created in the Android NDK are NOT connected
  to the JVM and JNI calls will fail.  This library wraps thread creation in
  such a way that pthreads created using it will connect to and disconnect from
  the JVM as appropriate.  Applications creating all of their threads with these
  interfaces can use the provided NVThreadGetCurrentJNIEnv() function to
  get the current thread's JNI context at any time.

  Note that native-created threads still have JNI limitations over threads
  that are calls down to native from Java.  The JNI function FindClass will
  NOT find application-specific classes when called from native threads.
  Native code that needs to call FindClass and record the indices of Java
  class members for later access must call FindClass and Get*FieldID/Get*MethodID
  in threads calling from Java, such as JNI_OnLoad
 */

/**
  Initializes the nv_thread system by connecting it to the JVM.  This
  function must be called as early as possible in the native code's
  JNI_OnLoad function, so that the thread system is prepared for any
  JNI-dependent library initialization calls.  
  @param vm The VM pointer - should be the JavaVM pointer sent to JNI_OnLoad.
